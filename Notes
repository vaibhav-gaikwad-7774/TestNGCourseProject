Notes: 

In eclipse where we can add the files in testNG xml files which we creates as "groupExample.java " file
in these file we will include the certain testcase which is include the 
proper testng.xml file which contain these code 

"<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "https://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd">
<suite name="TestNG Suite">
    <!-- Smoke Tests -->
    <test name="Smoke Tests">
        <groups>
            <run>
                <include name="smoke" />
            </run>
        </groups>
        <classes>
            <class name="com.example.tests.GroupExample" />
        </classes>
    </test>

    
</suite>
"

When we execute these code with the only testng.xml file we can conclude the test cases only two runs which is 
mention in the testng xml file mention and 

after that we added the 

"<!-- Regression Tests 
    <test name="Regression Tests">
        <groups>
            <run>
                <include name="regression" />
            </run>
        </groups>
        <classes>
            <class name="com.example.tests.GroupExample" />
        </classes>
    </test>-->" 
    
    regression test cases then we can see the files as 4 test cases will be executing as per the 
    testng.xml file execution in the testNG running suite
